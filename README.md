## What is this repository for?

The `.github` repository is a special repository that allows GitHub organizations to:

1. Display a README on the organization's profile page
2. Define organization-wide community health files like:
   - Code of conduct
   - Contributing guidelines
   - Issue templates
   - Pull request templates

For more information on how this works, see [GitHub's documentation on organization profiles](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/collaborating-with-groups-in-organizations/customizing-your-organizations-profile).
